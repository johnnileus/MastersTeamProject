For Generating a PS5 build, run the batch file and THEN open CMake GUI. Select the USE_AGC Option and set it to true and then generate. 
If there are any issues where it tells you about invalid platforms, make sure you have opened CMake GUI *after* running the batch file and generating the CMake Cache.

For generating a PC build just proceed as you would normally with CMake GUI.
